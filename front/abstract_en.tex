	Smartfarm in greenhouse is an advanced agricultural system that integrates smart technologies and data analytics to optimize crop growth and yield in a controlled environment. The proposed system uses a network of sensors and monitoring devices to collect data on various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and light intensity. This data is analyzed using machine learning algorithms to provide insights into crop growth patterns, predict yield.

	Smartfarm  is designed to provide real-time feedback to farmers and greenhouse managers, allowing them to make informed decisions about crop management. The proposed system also provides remote access to monitor and control the environment, such as adjusting temperature and humidity levels, and ensuring optimal growing conditions.
	
	The integration of Smartfarm  has numerous benefits, including increased efficiency, reduced resource consumption, and improved crop yields. The proposed system allows farmers to optimize their operations to produce more food sustainably while reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact.
	
	Overall, Smartfarm  represents a significant step forward in sustainable agriculture, and its potential to revolutionize the industry is significant. By leveraging advanced technology and data-driven insights, Smartfarm in greenhouse offers a new and more efficient way to grow crops in a controlled environment.
